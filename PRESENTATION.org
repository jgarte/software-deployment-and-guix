#+title: The Software Deployment Problem and Guix
#+startup align

* Have you ever written software that needs to work on another system?

** If so:

   You have most likely encountered the software deployment problem!

** You will need to ensure:

   - Dependencies are in place

   - It's built for the right target architecture

   - It contains no references to invalid paths

   - Et cetera!

** Some Examples

   1. Missing dependencies
      #+begin_example
      Suppose you write a bash script for your coworker to automate
      diffing images with ImageMagick.

      You send it to your coworker and they run it only for the script
      to die immediately.

      You forgot they don't have ImageMagick installed!
      #+end_example

   2. Managing shared mutable dependencies
      #+begin_example
      Not to suggest apt is nothing other than perfect, but imagine
      that a bug in apt was introduced where:

      You install nodejs which in depends on python3.

      You then install git which also depends on python3.

      You recursively remove the git dependency which removes the
      python3 dependency.

      You then try to rebuild nodejs and it dies because where is
      python3?
      #+end_example

      #+begin_example
      glibc had an update which changed a behavior or something.

      You have an old program looking in the same include/lib path as
      the old glibc.

      The program is now subtly busted.
      #+end_example

* What are paths though anyways?

** Paths are to files what pointers are to memory addresses

   "Functional package management" begins by "equating" file
   system and memory.

    [[https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf][Eelco Dolstra - The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model]]

    - Note the use of "Component" which is used to mean some
      deployable artifact

** Dependencies:

   Other artifacts in the closure environment of an artifact

** A "Functional package manager":

   A program that manages the "heap" of the file system

* The heap

  A directory that contains build artifacts and "other stuff" related
  to managing artifacts.

  In Guix this lives in /gnu/store:

  #+begin_src shell
  ls /gnu/store | tail -n 5
  #+end_src
